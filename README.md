#Inspiration
------------

We all are sick and tired of waiting or scheduling a visit with academic advisors. Why not bring the academic advisor home?
We thought of two main possible activities that are completed by an advisor in order to help a student i.e. Getting to know seniors and developing a course plan.

#What it does
-------------

Our web app collects data about the type of roles an individual is looking for example “Software Developer”, “Data Analyst”, etc. and also enquires about company’s name he/she aspires to work in. Along with the company, we have attached another determining variable called number of years of work experience. When a user enters in these values, the algorithm gives you a list of seniors that have worked in these companies working as mentioned specific roles.
The second part of the application helps in determining a course plan that a student should stick to based on the same 2 variables; role and years of work experience.

#How we built
--------------

Database – MySql
Languages used – HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery and PHP
Challenges we ran into
We had planned to implement a machine learning algorithm to come up with a course plan using R. we were unable to run R script on a webpage and integrate JS and PHP objects with R script. SO we decided not to work with R very late in our development.

#What’s Next for our app
--------------------------

Super cool machine learning algorithm and an extensive database consisting many students.
